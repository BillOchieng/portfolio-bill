      <description>My current research interest is app development with Xcode, Swift &amp;amp; SwiftUI. SwiftUI is Swifts graphical counter part, and is responsible for the graphics behind an iOS or MacOS app. It caught my attention as I like the idea of being able to create solutions for issues or inconveniences in mine, and others day to day life with their smartphones and computers. I also love how Xcode incorporates an emulator to preview each line of code as you right it in real time.</description>

      <description>Python is my favorite language I have learned, and the one I am most comfortable working with! I love its simple and elegant design. It is easy to pick up and quick to write. I have been working with python for the past 3 years now.</description>

      <title>Tic-Tac-Toe made with PySimpleGUI</title>

      <description>About the project You can find the current release on Tic-Tac-Toe!
This was a final project for my software engineering class, and was quite a challenging one. It was my first time implementing graphics into a Python program. This was done using PySimpleGUI which was a challenge in it self to learn, however well worth it. Over all the project was fun to complete, and gave the user a nice looking way to play tic-tac-toe against friends or an AI.</description>
