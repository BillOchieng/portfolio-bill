      <description>My current research interest is app development with Xcode, Swift &amp;amp; SwiftUI. SwiftUI is Swifts graphical counter part, and is responsible for the graphics behind an iOS or MacOS app. It caught my attention as I like the idea of being able to create solutions for issues or inconveniences in mine, and others day to day life with their smartphones and computers. I also love how Xcode incorporates an emulator to preview each line of code as you right it in real time.</description>
